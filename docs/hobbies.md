# Hobbies

## Youtube

I enjoy watching George Hotz past streams on Youtube. He is extremely hard
working and watching him navigate low level assembly in IDA goes a bit over my
head but I enjoy watching anyways. 


## Meetups

I also go for meetups here in New York. I recently went for the OWASP meetup.
They shared details about their organisation and their work and how we can
volunteer for them. Met a lot of interesting people there. Two guys that I met
there Mashoud and Arman are winning bug bounties for a living.
